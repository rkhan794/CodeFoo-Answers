            <p class="list-desc">The Northman hits theaters on April 22, 2022. Review by Siddhant Adlakha. <br>
            Robert Eggers' viking revenge saga The Northman works best when it dives head-first into <br>
            dreams and disorienting visions, but it slows down when it becomes a more traditional <br>
            Hollywood narrative. With viciousness relegated to its margins, it often feels neutered and <br>
            bloodless, but still ends up on the right side of entertaining thanks to its pulsating music <br>
            and measured performances.</p>
